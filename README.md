# QuickBreak

A full-stack web application for finding motorway service stations across the UK. QuickBreak helps drivers locate nearby stations, view facilities, read and submit reviews, save favourites, and navigate — all without leaving the app.

Built with the MERN stack, TomTom Maps SDK, and a rule-based voice assistant called Bexxa.

## 🎤 Bexxa Voice Commands

Bexxa is a **rule-based voice assistant** — it uses the browser's built-in Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis APIs. It does not use any AI or LLM.

| Say | What happens |
|-----|-------------|
| "Hey Bexxa, find EV chargers near me" | Searches nearby stations with EV facility |
| "Hey Bexxa, find fuel near me" | Searches for fuel stations |
| "Hey Bexxa, find nearest station" | Returns closest station |
| "Hey Bexxa, navigate" | Opens in-app navigation to last found station |
| "Hey Bexxa, details" | Opens station details page |
| "Hey Bexxa, create report" | Opens report form |
| "Hey Bexxa, help" | Lists available commands |

Works in Chrome and Edge (browsers with Web Speech API support).

## 🌍 Deployment

The backend serves the React frontend as static files from `BACKEND/public/`.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd FRONTEND && npm run build
# Copy dist/ contents to BACKEND/public/
cd BACKEND && npm start
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for full Render deployment instructions.
